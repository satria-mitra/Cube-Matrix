New data visualizations can be introduced, offering fresh perspectives and insights, and keeping the user's experience vibrant and current. This commitment to growth ensures that the Cube-Matrix Visualizer remains not only a tool for today but a lasting piece of art that continues to enrich lives.

## Market analysis

We are a small independent entrepreneurial company. Our product is an LED cube system that can visualize the air quality data (including CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity) collected by the sensor using an animation played by the LED cube.  This system uses an independent power supply and a wide voltage design, and can be used directly in most areas of the world. Users can use the buttons on the product base to switch animation modes and display different data. The cost of our product, without taking into account labor costs, is 126 pounds. It takes 24 hours of work for this team member to complete this product. If you consider London wage standards, the total cost is approximately 366 pounds, which is what we need solved problem.
Our target market is technology enthusiasts, education fields, and high-consumption groups. Our products will be crowdfunded on kickstarter.
Our opponents mainly fall into two categories. One is traditional LED cube kits, which are cheaper but cannot provide air quality detection functions. At the same time, they rarely sell finished products, which poses challenges to users’ technical capabilities and time. In addition, such products do not have the ability to interact with users. The other category is traditional air quality detectors, with similar accuracy, they are also cheaper, but they do not have furniture/decoration capabilities and lack the artistic expression of this product.
We will also provide free ota services to crowdfunding users to ensure the rights and interests of crowdfunding users.
Our current market areas are Europe and North America.

### SWOT.
- Advantage
LED CUBE with integrated air quality detection is a pioneering solution in the technology market, offering the dual functionality of air quality detection and visual display via an LED cube. This fusion of innovations not only differentiates the product but also captures a niche market consisting of technology enthusiasts, the education sector and high-spending groups. A significant advantage of this product is that users can interact with the product by changing animation modes and displaying various data, thus enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, providing over-the-air (OTA) updates to crowdfunding users signifies our commitment to product longevity and customer satisfaction.

- Weakness
Conversely, the product's market penetration may be hampered by its high production costs (approximately £366), placing it in a higher price range, which may limit its acceptance by a wider audience. The production process for each unit requires 24 hours of labor, which not only drives up costs and selling prices, but also cuts production capacity. Furthermore, relying on crowdfunding to enter the market creates financial uncertainty, as access to funds in this way depends on the dynamics of crowdfunding platforms and investor interest.

- Opportunities
As people's living standards improve, people's awareness and concern about air quality in residential and office environments continues to grow, providing important opportunities for market expansion. By finding foundries to reduce costs and selling prices, and upgrading product features, these measures will tap a wider audience and stimulate market growth. Strategic alliances with educational institutions or environmental organizations can open up new avenues of market penetration and enhance brand credibility.

- Threaten
Although this product has good prospects, it still faces severe competition. These threats come from traditional LED cube kits and air quality detectors, which despite their limited functionality compared to the author's team's products, appeal to consumers through lower prices. Additionally, there is a risk that a saturation of similar products with imitators may dilute the uniqueness of the product. Economic fluctuations further exacerbate these threats, as a recession may reduce the disposable income of high-spending groups and reduce their interest in purchasing such products.

In addition, this group introduces value chain analysis here. Through the exploration of main activities and supporting activities, this analysis describes how to add value and minimize costs, thereby enhancing the product's competitive advantage in the global market.

### Main activities
-Inbound logistics
The initial stage of the value creation process: procuring high-quality sensors and LEDs from reputable suppliers to ensure product quality. At the same time, efficient inventory management is required to minimize storage costs and avoid stock-outs, thereby maintaining a seamless production process.

-Operations
The assembly of the LED cube system is a critical operation. The development of custom firmware for animated data display is at the heart of the product's uniqueness. Strict quality assurance processes are also implemented to meet the safety and performance standards of the regions in which they are sold.

-Outbound logistics
Strategic packaging of products not only ensures their protection during transportation, but also focuses on an environmentally friendly ethos. Logistics partners are selected with a focus on reliability and cost-effectiveness to facilitate global delivery capabilities.
